mdevd - a mdev-compatible hotplug manager daemon
------------------------------------------------

 mdevd is a daemon managing kernel hotplug events, similarly to udevd.
 It uses the same configuration file as mdev, which is a hotplug
manager integrated in the Busybox suite of tools. However, mdev
needs to be registered as a hotplug manager and the kernel forks
an instance of mdev for every event; by contrast, mdevd is a daemon
listening to the netlink, and does not fork.
